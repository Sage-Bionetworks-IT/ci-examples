## Community examples

### R projects

The [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples) repo
contains examples of GitHub Actions workflows for testing R packages, building
pkgdown sites, and more. You can copy these into your project, or use
[helpers from usethis](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/actions_sandbox/packageci.html)
to set them up for you.
